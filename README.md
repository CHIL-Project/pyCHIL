C.H.I.L. stands for  - Cartographic Helper for Intrepid Land-explorers.

    CHIL is a simple tool written to help boy scouts in their adventures.
    Chil is a brahminy kite, a character in "The Jungle Book" by R. Kipling.
    He is the messenger of the jungle, he knows all the places and can observe
    everything from above ... so who better than he can help orienting?
    Are you in cartographic trouble? Just call Chil with his master word...
    Illo! Illo!
